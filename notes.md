# Day 22 – Git Notes

## 1. Difference between git add and git commit
git add moves changes to the staging area.
git commit saves staged changes to the repository.

## 2. What is staging area?
The staging area allows us to review and group changes before committing.

## 3. What does git log show?
It shows commit history, author, date, and commit messages.

## 4. What is .git folder?
.git stores all Git data like commits and history.
Deleting it removes Git tracking.

## 5. Working directory vs staging vs repository
Working directory: where files are edited  
Staging area: selected changes to commit  
Repository: committed history

## Divergent Branches

This happens when local and remote branches both have new commits.

Git stops and asks how to reconcile history.

Solutions:
- Merge: git pull --no-rebase (safe)
- Rebase: git pull --rebase (clean but risky)

Fast-forward merge → No new commit, pointer moves

Merge commit → Created when histories diverge

Merge conflict → Git needs human decision
